                <div id="paragraphe1">
                <p>Football has a rich history filled with legendary players who have shaped the sport and left a lasting legacy. One of the earliest icons of the game is Pelé, often hailed as the greatest footballer of all time. Born in Brazil, Pelé won three FIFA World Cups (1958, 1962, and 1970), a record that still stands today. Known for his incredible goal-scoring ability, creativity, and vision on the pitch, Pelé was a symbol of Brazil’s "samba football" style, captivating fans around the world with his flair and sportsmanship.</p></div>
